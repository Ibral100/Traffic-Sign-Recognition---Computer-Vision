 Description
This project focuses on identifying and classifying traffic signs using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built from scratch. Developed as a learning project, it explores the end-to-end workflow of a Deep Learning task: from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

The goal was to gain a deep understanding of **CNN architectures**, weight initialization, and the optimization process within the **PyTorch** ecosystem.



Learning Objectives
- Implementing a custom CNN architecture without using pre-trained models.
- Mastering PyTorch's `Dataset` and `DataLoader` for efficient data handling.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters (Learning Rate, Batch Size, Optimizer).
- Visualizing loss curves and accuracy metrics.

Dataset
The model is trained on a traffic sign dataset sourced from **Kaggle**.
